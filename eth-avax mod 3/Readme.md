## Description

 In this file, a smart contract was created and compiled using Local Hardhat network.

The contract has been tested and deployed using Remix IDE. The functionalities of the contract has been explained in this Loom video  https://www.loom.com/share/caffd989cb684a30b372da2f987c99e5?sid=4b2ca029-46d9-4d15-93ba-85a27d4aa4f6
